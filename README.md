# CMS Synthetic Data Exploration

## CMS 2008-2010 Data Entrepreneurs’ Synthetic Public Use File (DE-SynPUF)

This is a synthetic patient dataset in the OMOP Common Data Model v5.2, originally released by the CMS. The dataset includes 24 tables and records for 2 million synthetic patients from 2008 to 2010.

The DE-SynPUF was created with the goal of providing a realistic set of claims data in the public domain while providing the very highest degree of protection to the Medicare beneficiaries’ protected health information.  The purposes of the DE-SynPUF are to:

1. allow data entrepreneurs to develop and create software and applications that may eventually be applied to actual CMS claims data;
2. train researchers on the use and complexity of conducting analyses with CMS claims data prior to initiating the process to obtain access to actual CMS data; and,
3. support safe data mining innovations that may reveal unanticipated knowledge gains while preserving beneficiary privacy.

## Purpose of Project

Explore a sample of the synthetic data available to practice data engineering skills and conduct exploratory data analysis. Note that the total synthetic sample provided is 5% of the Medicare beneficiaries 2008 population and their claims from 2008-2010. One sample of the 20 downloadable files thus represents a 0.25% sample, convenient for researchers to determine what size of sample they would like to work with.
